Prompt: How is high blood pressure diagnosed and treated?

Fine-tuned Model Response:
How is high blood pressure diagnosed and treated? Diagnosis High blood pressure is diagnosed based on your blood pressure numbers and your medical history. Blood pressure numbers are written with two numbers separated by a slash. For example, a blood pressure result of 120/70 is said as 120 over 70. The top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. The bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats

Base Gemma-2b Model Response:
How is high blood pressure diagnosed and treated?

High blood pressure is diagnosed by taking blood pressure readings at different times.

If your blood pressure is consistently high for several readings, it’s classified as high blood pressure.

If your blood pressure is consistently lower, you don’t have high blood pressure.

However, if you have high blood pressure for a short period of time, you don’t necessarily have high blood pressure.

For example, after you exercise or have a meal high in salt, your blood pressure can temporarily

What are the most effective ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19? There is no single way to eliminate it. The key to fighting the coronavirus is to prevent transmission. Prevention is about limiting the chances of someone getting sick and sharing the virus with others, but it is not foolproof. People can and do spread the virus even when they have no symptoms.

Prompt: What does an abnormal EKG result mean?

Fine-tuned Model Response:
What does an abnormal EKG result mean?
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast the heart is beating and its rhythm (steady or irregular). An EKG also records the strength and timing of electrical signals as they pass through each part of the heart.
                
An EKG can show signs of a heart problem, such as:
                
An irregular heartbeat
                
A slow heartbeat

Fine-tuned Model Response:
What’s the safest way to taper off antidepressants? When stopping antidepressants, it is important to do so gradually. Tapering off antidepressants is as safe as staying on them, as long as there is a gradual reduction in dosage. You may find it helpful to consult with your doctor before stopping your medication. He or she can help determine the appropriate dosage to reduce, as well as help determine the best course of action if you experience unpleasant side effects when stopping the medication.
