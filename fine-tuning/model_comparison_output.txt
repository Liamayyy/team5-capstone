Base Gemma-2b Model Response:
What does an abnormal EKG result mean?

EKG (Electrocardiogram) is a test that helps detect heart problems and abnormal heart rhythms. It measures the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. An EKG is a common test to diagnose heart disease.

In a normal EKG, the electrical activity of the heart is a series of waves. An EKG is a graphic record of the electrical impulses that travel through the heart. If the heart is not working properly, the waves will be distorted.

Normal EKG results can vary

What are the symptoms and treatments for hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones that regulate the body. This can result in fatigue, muscle aches, and a slower metabolism. The most common treatments for hypothyroidism include thyroid hormone replacement medication and surgery. If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, it is important to seek treatment as soon as possible to avoid potential complications.

[Answer 1]

A few things to consider:

<strong>1.</strong> Your doctor has not told you that your depression is due to a drug deficiency.

<strong>2.</strong> Your doctor has not told you that you should wean off of a drug.

<strong>3.</strong> Weaning off a drug is a big step.
